The "Recipe App" project aims to develop an Full Stack Application where users can share, search for, and interact with recipes. This APP will enable users to create accounts, save their favorite recipes, and engage with the community by rating and commenting on recipes. By providing a platform for culinary enthusiasts to discover and exchange recipes, this APP aims to foster a vibrant cooking community.
